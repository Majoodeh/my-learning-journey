## Inline Styling for React Elements

what is the inline styling for react elements?

- It is the way to add styles directly to the react elements using the style attribute.
- The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties instead of a CSS string.
- this very important to note that in React, the style attribute must be passed an object, not a string. and the property names should be in camelCase instead of kebab-case.

### Example:

- in normal HTML/CSS, you would write:

```html
<div style="background-color: blue; color: white; padding: 10px;">
  This is a styled div.
</div>
```

as you can see here, the style attribute is a string containing CSS properties and values, and it uses kebab-case for property names (like background-color).

- in React, you would write:

```jsx
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "blue", color: "white", padding: "10px" }}>
  This is a styled div.
</div>
```

In this React example, the style attribute is passed a JavaScript object with camelCased property names (like backgroundColor) and string values.

- n otice that styling in react is an object, wich means that we use commas to separate different style properties. and the values are usually strings, even when the value is a number with units (like "10px"), or the attribute can also accept multiple data (like border: "1px solid black").

example with multiple styles:

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "lightgray",
    color: "black",
    padding: "20px",
    border: "2px solid black",
    borderRadius: "5px",
  }}
>
  This is a styled div with multiple styles.
</div>
```

## How to create a Component in React?

1.  Create a new JavaScript file with a .jsx or .js extension.

- [! important](name of the file should start with a capital letter)

2.  Import React from the 'react' library.

```jsx
import React from "react";
```

3.  Define a function or class that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) representing the component's structure.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is my first React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

4.  Export the component so it can be used in other parts of the application.

```jsx
export default MyComponent;
```

[? Why default?] (because it allows you to import the component without using curly braces, making it easier to use in other files.)

5.  Import and use the component in other parts of your React application.
    Note: you can import it using its extension or without it. but preferably without it.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent /> // use it as a custom HTML tag
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

### The common structure of a react project:

```
my-react-app/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── MyComponent.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...
```
