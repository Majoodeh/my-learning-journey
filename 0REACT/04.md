## Mapping Data to Components in React:

- why to use it?
  - When we have a list of data (array or object) that we want to display in our React app, we can use `map()` method to iterate over the data and create a new array of React components for each item in the list.
  - so instead of manually creating components for each item, we can use `map()` to dynamically generate them based on the data we have.
