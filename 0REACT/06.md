## HTML Event Attributes

HTML event attributes are special attributes that can be added to HTML elements to handle events, such as clicks, mouse movements, key presses, and more. In React, these event attributes are written in camelCase and are passed as props to React components.

We can put them in categories like this:

1. Mouse Events: onClick, onDoubleClick, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMouseMove
2. Keyboard Events: onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress
3. Form Events: onChange, onSubmit, onFocus, onBlur (form are [input, select, textarea, form])
4. Window Events: onLoad, onResize, onScroll
5. Clipboard Events: onCopy, onCut, onPaste
6. Media Events: onPlay, onPause, onEnded
7. Drag Events: onDragStart, onDragOver, onDrop
